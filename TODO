See the MILESTONES section in the OurNet::BBS manpage.

Known issues for 1.62:
- bin/bbscomd still disables CIPH_PGP due to occasional unstability.
- GC-over-callback hasn't been made to work. I wonder if it could be at all.
- although there's plenty of new comments, the promised documentations are
  still sorely lacking.
- various applets: echo-agent, ournet-icq/-irc, sob2melix, etc are not there.
- callback events are only checked on each calls to Client; there are no
  ways to say 'loop for this many seconds' yet.
- using of RPC inside callback events are guaranteed not to work.
