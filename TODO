TODO for 1.5:

- better-polished bin/bbscomd, including the ability to serve as proxy
- bbscomd authentication model
- A better README and overall documentation
- integration of PlClient, PlServer, Base and Cell into Cell
- add locating, security and session to BBSCOM-RPC.

Please mail your ideas to autrijus@autrijus.org.
